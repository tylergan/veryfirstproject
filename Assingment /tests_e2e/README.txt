Purpose: This tests everything through my End-to-End testing; this includes:
    • Moving around a simple board
    • Invalid inputs
    • Capital letter inputs
    • The wait and quit command
    • Interactions with objects in the matrix such as the water, fire, teleport, wall, start and end instances.
    • Trying to move outside of the valid bounds of the board
    • Uneven and complex board configurations
