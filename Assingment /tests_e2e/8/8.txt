### TEST CASE 8 ###
We are testing an important edge case: going out of bounds. This board has no walls and provides the player the ability to leave the board whereever. Hence, this test
is to ensure that when the player tries to leave the board, the wall.step() instance method is initiated; this is edge and positiev case testing.
