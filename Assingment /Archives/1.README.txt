Purpose: This is all the different algorithms I created for the solver. 

Note: 
    • solver2 is exactly the same as my original solver, however it imports the queue module if you are interested in that!
    • solver_path was initial inspiration from a YouTuber called TechWithTim
    • solver_class was an attempt to create a huge binary tree of potential moves. However, this involved the use of importing disallowed modules, such as deepcopy.
